Hey there! I'm Nikos Tsompanidis, a Fullstack Software Engineer with over 6 years of experience, specializing in backend development. 
Whether it's crafting robust software with JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Node.js, or managing databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB, I've got you covered. 
APIs? RESTful or GraphQL, consider it sorted. 
Plus, I'm not just all about coding; I'm also passionate about Functional Programming and I dabble in making memes for fun.

In my free time, I enjoy activities that help me relax and pursue my interests. I love reading books to expand my knowledge and traveling to experience different cultures and cuisines. For physical activity, I enjoy cycling, playing basketball, and football to stay fit and healthy. I also love cooking and trying out new recipes. Lastly, I enjoy watching movies as a way to relax and unwind.
